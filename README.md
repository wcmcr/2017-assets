## Branding Basics

A quick primer on the branding, pending a full write up

### Type

Text makes use of 1 main typeface, [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

### Colour and Emphasising Text


 - #eea548 is our golden orange main logo colour, use for emphasis instead of bold, and calls to action
 - #604b43 is used for body text and headings
 - #d1bca9 is a desaturated gold used for heading underlines, also use a shortened line

### Backgrounds

Try to make use of the hexagon regular pattern in the hexagon subfolder, or a blank white background if not possible. Try to line up either the horizontal bars or a diagonal with the main logos hexagon in any artwork produced.

In some cases, a separate background might be necessary. An example of this is the website, which uses the above for the header, but has a solid background colour below the menu. In this case, use the colour #f6efef.
